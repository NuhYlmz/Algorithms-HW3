*****Class Name: Main
- Read input.txt file and create BST with these inputs.
- Takes input from user and check this with switch-case.
- Create algoritm's class object and run functions to print outputs that the user wants.
*****Class Name: Graph
- Keeps citynames and distances(between them).
*****Class Name: Node
- It is node for Tree.
- Also, keeps zip_key, graph object, right and left nodes.
*****Class Name: BinarySearchTree
- Using to create a binary search tree with nodes.
- insert: Used to add a new node to BST.
- search: Takes inputs node(root) and key. Find the node that zip_code is registered to. Give output this node.
- printPreorder: Print out the preorder traversal of the BST tree, create BST object and call bfs func to print out the cities in the node by using Breadth-First Search.
*****Class Name: Dijkstra
- Using to find the shortest path and the total length of the distance between two cities by Dijsktra’s algorithm.
*****Class Name: BreadFirstSearch
- Used to print out the cities in the node by using Breadth-First Search
- bfs: to run algorithm.
*****Class Name: Kruskal
- Using to print out the minimum spanning tree of the cities in this node by using Kruskal’s algorithm.
- kruskalMST: to run algorithm and return output.
